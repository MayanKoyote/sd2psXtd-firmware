# Changelog

## 1.4.0 - 2026-07-08

### Features

- Added a USB-CDC command interface for card/channel switching, Game ID selection, PS1/PS2 mode changes, PS2 variant changes, help, and device/bootloader reset commands.
- Added PS2 card-size handling for larger cards, including 128 MB card creation from settings/GUI and validation for existing images up to 2 GB.
- Added PS2 MMCEMAN commands for atomic card-and-channel selection and filesystem rename operations.
- Added PS1 MMCE reset support and direct PS1 MMCE set-card/set-channel handling.
- Added settings and GUI controls for enabling/disabling PS1 controller combos and limiting the maximum card index per mode.
- Added SD-root `splash.bin` deployment so a splash image can be imported into flash automatically at boot.
- Added support for different-sized flash chips to make firmware builds more flexible because of the current chip supply crisis.
- Added SD-card CID/details to diagnostics and the on-device Info menu.
- Updated splashgen with a modern simple/advanced UI, histogram preview, Otsu/adaptive thresholding, dithering, input levels, invert output, improved selection behavior, and UF2 validation.

### Fixes

- Fixed PS1 Game2Folder mapping so the mapped folder is not overwritten by the raw parent Game ID.
- Fixed Game ID, card, and channel edge cases around boot cards, Game ID cards, and card switching.
- Fixed multiple overflow and bounds risks in Game ID parsing, card configuration parsing, MMCEMAN paths, and filesystem command handling.
- Fixed stale PS2 data-interface operations and history-tracker slot data during card changes.
- Fixed invalid PS2 card images causing fatal errors by moving corrupt/invalid images aside and recreating them.
- Fixed PS2 MagicGate key-select handling to use only the documented low parameter bits.
- Improved SD write reliability with retries and more useful SD failure diagnostics.
- Fixed PMC three-button handling and related input initialization issues.

### Changed behavior

- USB-CDC stdio is now enabled for release builds so the serial command interface is available outside debug firmware.
- Settings serialization now includes `EnableControllerCombo` and `MaxCardIdx`, and settings files are rewritten with truncation to remove stale content.
- Flash layout is now derived from detected flash capacity, with fallback handling for the legacy splash offset.
- Card selection now honors configured maximum-card-index limits for PS1 and PS2.
- Channel up/down behavior on non-GUI builds now clamps at the valid range edge instead of wrapping invisibly.
- PS2 card formatting now builds the superblock and FAT data dynamically for the selected card size.
- Imported SD-root `splash.bin` files are removed after successful deployment to flash.

## 1.3.0 - 2025-11-02

### Features

- Added a customizable splash screen with the splashgen UF2 workflow and persistent flash storage.
- Added game image screens for memory-card folders, with channel-specific images taking precedence over card-level images.
- Added full SoulCalibur 2 Conquest Card support, including the required Conquest-specific ECC behavior.
- Added the splashgen utility and updated database tooling support.

### Fixes

- Improved the invalid virtual memory-card size error screen.
- Fixed GUI issues around menu state, card switching while in menus, and display refresh behavior.
- Fixed splash and animation states that could run forever or leave the device stuck on the splash screen.
- Reduced unnecessary PS1 GUI refreshes.
- Fixed display-related issues and removed the need for a Python virtual environment when building the database.

### Changed behavior

- Reworked the GUI around explicit splash, main, menu, switching, and game-image states.
- Game image lookup now checks for a channel-specific `<card>-<channel>.bin` file before falling back to `<card>.bin`.
- Custom splash data persists through normal firmware updates.
- Unknown PSRAM IDs no longer immediately trigger a fatal error or enter QSPI mode unless the detected ID is known-good.
- Conquest mode now uses its own CRC/ECC handling instead of the standard PS2 ECC path.

## 1.2.1 - 2025-07-18

### Features

- Added support for the second arcade/Conquest mode, including the `CONQUEST` setting, `MemoryCards/SC2` path, and arcade key support.
- Extended MagicGate key-select handling to match the official `0x7F` command behavior.
- Added DMA-backed I2C display transfers and refined PIO loading/unloading behavior.

### Fixes

- Fixed maximum-channel handling for card configurations.
- Fixed Game ID mapping to use the parent Game ID when transmitted.
- Switched back to the default card when an invalid Game ID is received or after boot-card handling completes.
- Improved PS1 memory-card emulation, ACK timing, PS2 multitap handling, and card-selection tracking.
- Improved CIV confirmation behavior.
- Fixed DMA channel claiming so channels are claimed once instead of repeatedly during transfers.
- Ignored the `0x7F` key-select command outside retail mode.

### Changed behavior

- The second arcade mode is serialized as `CONQUEST` and uses `MemoryCards/SC2` for card storage.
- Channel getters no longer clamp values above the previous maximum, allowing per-card maximum channel settings to work correctly.
- Mode lookups can use the current temporary mode during transitions.
- PS2 data PIO now keeps ACK low for the full transfer for faster and more stable operation.

## 1.2.0 - 2025-04-27

### Features

- Added Net Yaroze Access Card support.
- Added a PS1 controller combo to switch to the boot card with `L1 + R1 + L2 + R2 + SELECT`.
- Added onboard PMC+/PMCZero button support for boot-card loading and card/channel switching.
- Added LED status support, including WS2812/PMCZero LED handling and activity indications for writes, card switches, and MMCE file-system activity.
- Replaced the old PS1 ODEMAN flow with a PS1 MMCE task and command handling.
- Added the new project logo.

### Fixes

- Fixed button initialization and controller-combo handling.
- Fixed card switching becoming stuck on Core 1.
- Fixed PS2 multitap behavior with the Net Yaroze Access Card.
- Improved reset detection.

- Ensured the PS2 history tracker completes before card switching.

- Fixed LED, log-level, and missing-include issues.

### Changed behavior

- PS1 card initialization now tries the Game ID card before falling back to the boot card.
- PS2 card manager now starts in an unknown/inaccessible state until the card has been opened.
- SD-mode accessibility now allows use except while a card is being created.
- PS1 card switching now waits for controller input to be released, flushes the current card, and reopens the selected card before entering emulation.
- LED code moved from the flat `src/led.c` implementation into the `src/led/` library.

## 1.1.1 - 2025-03-04

### Features

- No user-facing features; this was a maintenance release.

### Fixes

- Improved SD-mode detection for PS2 cards, especially on PSRAM-less devices and large-card configurations.

### Changed behavior

- PS2 card accessibility and loading decisions now use the data-interface SD-mode state instead of raw PSRAM and card-size checks.

## 1.1.0 - 2025-03-03

### Features

- Added PS1 controller combos for card and channel switching.
